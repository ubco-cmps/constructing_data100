# DATA 100 Course Syllabus

**DATA 100 001 - Introduction to Data Science in Python (3)**

## Course Description

DATA 100 (3) Introduction to Data Science in Python (3)

Fundamentals of data science with an emphasis on computational thinking, testing, debugging, and working with data sets. Real-world applications from disciplines in the sciences, humanities, medicine, engineering, social sciences, and others. No prior computing background is required.

**Prerequisite:** None

**Equivalence:** COSC 100

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. develop the ability to "think computationally" using programming principles.
1. practice the creation of loops, conditionals, and functions to analyze data.
1. identify and use different data types to accomplish a variety of data science tasks.
1. apply common workflows to load, process, clean, and analyze data.
1. appraise the quality of data and assess its limitations in answering questions.
1. understand the role of testing and version control to writing sustainable code.
1. create reproducible, ethical, and sustainable data analyses.
1. apply the skills and techniques in this course to generate reproducible analyses.

## Assessment

| Item           | Weight | Frequency       |
|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Learning Logs  | 10%    | Weekly          |
| Labs           | 30%    | Weekly          |
| Project        | 30%    | Weekly          |
| Tests          | 30%    | Bi-weekly       |

### Passing Criteria

All students must satisfy ALL conditions to pass the course:

1. Pass the Labs with an average grade of at least 50%, with no more than 4 missed labs.
1. Pass the Tests with an average grade of at least 50%.
1. Pass the Project with a grade of at least 40%.
1. Pass the Course overall with a grade of at least 50%.

If a student does not satisfy the appropriate requirements, the student will be assigned the **lower** of their earned course grade or, a maximum overall grade of 45 in the course.

## Textbook

Portions of the following (open source) textbooks will be assigned as reading:

- [Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
- [Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)

Eventually, an open textbook will be developed using open resources.
